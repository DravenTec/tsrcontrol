# tsrcontrol
Control Script for Twitch-Stream-Recorder (tsr.py)

## tsrcontrol.sh
Since I record various streams I made the tsrcontrol to make my life easier.

Allows to easily create systemd services via the root account to create recorders.

When starting the script you will be asked for the username to run tsr.py, 
just put the tsr.py in the home folder of the user. Or adjust the path in the script.
